# ArduinoPrototypingShield
Single prototyping shield for Arduino UNO compatible board.

## PCB manufacturing
Schematics, gerbers and Bill of Materials (BOM) are available under *Electronic Design* directory. PCBs can be oredered on JLCPCB or any other PCB manufacturer. It is recommended to buy components from reliable sources like Mouse, Farnell, Digikey, TME. All symbols and footprints on the schematics was acquired from mouser page.

## Bill of Materials
Only certain types of male gold pins are needed:
* 2x8 
* 1x10 
* 1x6  
You can buy the long version and cut them to the required length.
